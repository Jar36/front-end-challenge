### Frontend Challenge Assignment for Bloc.io

## Description

This is a code challenge for the bloc.io Designer Track frontend fundamentals module. The project began with user research, sketching, wire framing, prototypes, design review, and now this coded version of my vision.

## Challenges

**Description**

The design attempts to provide a solution for a transit application that allows users to search and view buses at the *"Washington and State"* bus stop.

**Design**

The major challenges that I faced as a student in UX/UI design was to be able to understand current design patterns, typographical hierarchy, and iOS HUI guidelines to create an effective solution for a iOS mobile app.

**Code**

Initially I set out to code the design as a standard screen with no background. I then decided that I wanted to use a CSS image that I had created fro practice weeks prior on CodePen of an iPhone. After pulling that code over to this project I began with a standard approach.

My main frustration was with my grid system. I then made the decision to create a new branch and refactor my code using Flexbox where needed.

Once I was happy with the outcome I pushed the branch and merged it with master.

Although there is semantic HTML you will find a lot of general divs, mostly used with the CSS image where it does not seem to be needed since the structure of the phone does not hold any actual content except for the screen content. 

## Code

The entire site with the exception of the map was coded using HTML and CSS. This includes the iPhone CSS image which is used as the background for the content and the status-bar at the top of the phone screen.

I used Flexbox when needed to simplify my layout and reduce lines of code.

I chose to use the Eric Myers CSS reset in my normalize file and added a custom favicon.

All icons are imported via fontawesome CDN, and fonts are from googlefonts.  

There is no JS or Backend integration so the site is not fully functional in the sense that a user would be able to view real bus stops, use the search field, click buttons, or use the map.

This project was coded as a demonstration of skill using HTML and CSS obtained in the Frontend Fundamentals module.
