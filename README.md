# front-end-challenge
### Frontend Challenge Assignment for Bloc.io
This is a code challenge for the bloc.io Designer Track frontend fundamentals module. The project began with user research, sketching, wire framing, prototypes, design review, and now this coded version of my vision.

The design attempts to provide a solution for a transit application that allows users to search and view buses at the *"Washington and State"* bus stop.

It is not fully functional in the sense that you can actually view real bus stops, but rather a demonstration of skill obtained in the Frontend Fudamentals module.
